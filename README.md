#Idea

One line that encapsulates/describes the entire idea of your website

Magic the gathering deck building showcase and competition request.

#Motivation

Describing why this is a good idea. Why would someone want to use
your website? Why is this of interest to you? Aside from the fact that this project is a required
component for the course, why do you want to build this particular project?

My website would allow users to theorycraft when making their decks. The website also allows
users to connect by giving feedback on each other's decks so that they can get better at the game.
The website helps with finding someone to play with. I personally would have my cards ready to
go but no one plays against.The reason I want to make this website is because during the
pandemic with being stuck at home I’ve decided to pick up the game of Magic. I began to fall in
love with the game when I started to play with my brothers and friends. I wanted to make this
website so that players of the game have a place to search up cards and find new ways to
improve their games. I want the website to connect players and allow them to always have a
game to play.

# Application

Describing the website functionality. What is it? What can users do
with it?

In my website players of Magic the Gathering would be able to look through a database of cards
throughout Magic’s history. In the database it would show information about each card with its
stats, text, and what set the card is a part of and where to get them. The user would be able to
select the card and put it into a personal digital deck with their profile. The user can decide to
make their deck public for other users to see. When the decks are public users can give
comments and feedback about the deck. Users can also request matches online or in person to
other users.
